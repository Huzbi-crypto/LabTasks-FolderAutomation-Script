# Introduction

This is a personal script written in Python that creates the following folder structure:

`Lab-0/source_codes/`

It then asks the user for an integer number to create that many cpp files.

It's mostly made for my own needs since I'm learning C++ right now and it's a pain to strucuture my lab tasks folder everytime.
