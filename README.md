# Introduction

This is a script that creates a structured (for me, that is ^_~) order of files and folders of lab tasks for our DSA course. 

## How it works

1. It first asks the users to enter their lab no. to create a folder accordingly.
2. Then it asks the number of C++ files to create.
3. It then asks the user to enter their student ID so that it gets attached to file names. We need this as a prove that this was done by us.

It's mostly made for my own needs since I'm learning C++ right now and it's a pain to strucuture my lab tasks folder everytime.

## Instructions

To use the `.py` script, make sure you have Python installed. If you don't, you can download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can also download the binary file directly if you don't have Python installed from [here](https://github.com/Huzbi-crypto/LabTasks-FolderAutomation-Script/releases/download/v1.0.0/createLabFilesv1.0.0.exe).

_Executable release is not upto latest changes to the code. I'll make one when I get the time. (┬┬﹏┬┬)_
