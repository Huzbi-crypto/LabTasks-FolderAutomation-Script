# Introduction

This repo contains scripts that I've created for my university courses. Currently, they contain only creation of files, but more scripts will be addd as per the need. 

It's mostly made for my own needs since I'm learning C++ and COAL right now and it's a pain to strucuture my lab tasks's folders everytime.

## Instructions

To use the `.py` script, make sure you have Python installed. If you don't, you can download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can also download the binary file directly if you don't have Python installed from [here](https://github.com/Huzbi-crypto/LabTasks-FolderAutomation-Script/releases/download/v1.0.0/createLabFilesv1.0.0.exe).

_Executable release is not upto latest changes to the code. I'll make one when I get the time. (┬┬﹏┬┬)_
