# Introduction

This is a personal script written in Python that creates the following folder structure:

`Lab-0/source_codes/`

It then asks the user for an integer number to create that many cpp files.

It's mostly made for my own needs since I'm learning C++ right now and it's a pain to strucuture my lab tasks folder everytime.

## Instructions

To use the `.py` script, make sure you have Python installed. If you don't, you can download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can also download the binary file directly if you don't have Python installed from [here](https://github.com/Huzbi-crypto/LabTasks-FolderAutomation-Script/releases/download/v1.0.0/createLabFilesv1.0.0.exe).
